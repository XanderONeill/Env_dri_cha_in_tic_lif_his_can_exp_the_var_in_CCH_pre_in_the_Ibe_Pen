# Read Me File for the Ecological Modelling Paper titled: Environmental driven changes in tick life history can explain the variation in CCHFV prevalence in the Iberian Peninsula
# by Xander O'Neill, Andy White, Christian Gortazar, and Fran Ruiz-Fons. 

# Demographic File contains code used to simulate the seasonal model capturing the demographic processes in the Iberian Peninsula tick-host system.
# Epidemiology File contains code used to simulate the Iberian Peninsula tick-host system with CCHFV
# Vary_reproduction provides example code used when varying the reproductive rate of ticks and its effect on the epidemiological dynamics. This code is straightforward to adapt for varying other key paramters as discussed in the paper.
